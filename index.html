	        A few <span class="pink">years</span> back <b>Candy Crush</b> was one of the most popular games. It has been one of the top 5 highest grossing apps from 2013 to 2017. Everyone who had any sort of electronic device was playing Candy Crush or one of the hundreds of the clones of it. Even before that, in elementary school, everyone was playing a game called Clash of Clans.

            There is one thing that <i>almost</i> every mobile game has in common: they all have some way to use real money to do an action in the game. For Clash of Clans, you can get gems to speed up building things and farming things. In Candy Crush, you only get a certain number of “plays” before you either have to spend money to get more “plays” or you can post an advertisement for the game on facebook for a “play”. This shows how smart but also malicious the app developers of Candy Crush have been. They force people to post on their private Facebook pages a link to the game to encourage more people to download Candy Crush. The app has been downloaded over half a billion times in 2013 and a staggering 2.73 billion times. For context, that is about 36% of people on the earth, 20% of people in the US.

            <span class="blackback">Anyways</span>, I <div class="annoy">see</div> so many people on their screens. Either in the cafeteria at school, Starbucks or even in the library. These devices with screens have become so addictive over the years, it begs the question, why and how are these devices so addictive? Is the big corporation giving us this life-changing app or game for free just out of the kindness of their heart or what are we paying, if not money how else do they profit off us.
